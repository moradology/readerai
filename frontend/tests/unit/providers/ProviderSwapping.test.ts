/**
 * Provider Swapping Behavior Tests
 *
 * Critical Behaviors to Guarantee:
 *
 * PROVIDER INTERFACES:
 * - All providers implement the same interface correctly
 * - Swapping providers doesn't break functionality
 * - Feature detection works for optional capabilities
 * - Fallbacks activate when features are unsupported
 * - Provider errors are handled consistently
 *
 * RUNTIME SWITCHING:
 * - Providers can be changed without app restart
 * - Active sessions migrate to new provider gracefully
 * - User settings persist across provider changes
 * - Performance remains stable during switches
 * - No data loss occurs during transition
 *
 * DEMO TO PRODUCTION:
 * - Demo provider works identically to production
 * - Switching from demo to real preserves state
 * - API credentials are validated before switching
 * - Errors in production fall back to demo
 * - Cost tracking activates with paid providers
 *
 * MULTI-PROVIDER SCENARIOS:
 * - Different providers can be used per feature
 * - TTS and audio providers work independently
 * - Provider selection is configurable per user
 * - A/B testing between providers is supported
 * - Analytics track provider performance
 *
 * PROVIDER FAILURES:
 * - Failed providers don't crash the app
 * - Fallback chains work automatically
 * - Users are notified of degraded functionality
 * - Retry logic is appropriate per provider
 * - Provider health is monitored continuously
