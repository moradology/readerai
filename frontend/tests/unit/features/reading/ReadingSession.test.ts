/**
 * Reading Session Behavior Tests
 *
 * Critical Behaviors to Guarantee:
 *
 * SESSION LIFECYCLE:
 * - A new reading session should start with the first word unhighlighted
 * - Starting a session should begin audio playback automatically
 * - Pausing should stop audio and maintain current position
 * - Resuming should continue from the exact word where paused
 * - Session state should persist across page refreshes
 * - Ending a session should save progress and cleanup resources
 *
 * WORD SYNCHRONIZATION:
 * - The highlighted word should match the audio timestamp precisely
 * - Seeking to a word should update both visual and audio position
 * - Word highlighting should advance smoothly without skips
 * - Multiple rapid seeks should not break synchronization
 * - Playback speed changes should maintain word-audio sync
 *
 * ERROR RECOVERY:
 * - Network interruptions should not crash the reading experience
 * - Audio loading failures should show appropriate user feedback
 * - WebSocket disconnections should gracefully degrade features
 * - The app should attempt to recover from transient failures
 * - User progress should never be lost due to errors
 *
 * PERFORMANCE:
 * - Starting a session should be responsive (< 2 seconds)
 * - Word highlighting should not cause visible lag
 * - Large passages should not degrade performance
 * - Memory usage should remain stable during long sessions
