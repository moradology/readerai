/**
 * WebSocket Resilience Behavior Tests
 *
 * Critical Behaviors to Guarantee:
 *
 * CONNECTION MANAGEMENT:
 * - WebSocket should connect automatically on app start
 * - Connection failures should trigger automatic retry
 * - Retry delays should use exponential backoff
 * - Maximum retry attempts should prevent infinite loops
 * - Successful reconnection should restore session state
 *
 * MESSAGE DELIVERY:
 * - Messages sent while disconnected should be queued
 * - Queued messages should send once reconnected
 * - Message order should be preserved
 * - Duplicate messages should be prevented
 * - Critical messages should be acknowledged
 *
 * STATE SYNCHRONIZATION:
 * - Reconnection should sync current reading position
 * - Checkpoint states should be reconciled
 * - Progress updates should not be lost
 * - Conflicts should be resolved sensibly
 * - User should see connection status clearly
 *
 * GRACEFUL DEGRADATION:
 * - Core reading should work without WebSocket
 * - Features should disable gracefully when offline
 * - Offline indicators should be clear but not intrusive
 * - Local-first features should remain functional
 * - Recovery should be seamless when connection returns
 *
 * PERFORMANCE:
 * - Reconnection should not freeze the UI
 * - Message processing should not block interactions
 * - Memory usage should be bounded (no infinite queues)
 * - Connection cycling should not leak resources
