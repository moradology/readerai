/**
 * Audio Playback Behavior Tests
 *
 * Critical Behaviors to Guarantee:
 *
 * PLAYBACK CONTROL:
 * - Play should start audio from current position
 * - Pause should stop immediately without audio artifacts
 * - Seek should jump to precise timestamps
 * - Playback rate changes should maintain pitch
 * - Volume controls should work smoothly
 *
 * STREAMING BEHAVIOR:
 * - Audio should start playing before fully downloaded
 * - Buffering should happen intelligently ahead of playback
 * - Network stutters should not interrupt playback
 * - Quality should adapt to network conditions
 * - Resume should work after buffering pauses
 *
 * SYNCHRONIZATION:
 * - Time updates should fire at consistent intervals
 * - Current time should be accurate to 100ms
 * - Duration should be available once metadata loads
 * - Seek operations should update time immediately
 * - Events should fire in predictable order
 *
 * CROSS-BROWSER COMPATIBILITY:
 * - Playback should work on all major browsers
 * - Mobile browsers should handle background playback
 * - Audio focus should be managed properly on mobile
 * - Bluetooth headphone controls should work
 * - Browser autoplay policies should be handled
 *
 * RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
 * - Memory should be freed when audio is unloaded
 * - Multiple audio instances should not conflict
 * - Switching passages should cleanup properly
 * - Long sessions should not accumulate resources
 * - Errors should not leave resources hanging
