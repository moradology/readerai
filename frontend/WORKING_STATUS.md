# Working Status

## ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **React Child Error**: Fixed the "Objects are not valid as a React child" error by properly rendering the question object properties instead of the object itself.

2. **Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript types for the question object in the API response.

3. **Tests**: Basic test setup is working with Vitest and React Testing Library.

## ✅ What's Currently Working

### 1. Redux Store

- ✅ Store configuration with RTK
- ✅ Typed hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector)
- ✅ Redux DevTools integration
- ✅ Play/Pause demo functionality

### 2. RTK Query API

- ✅ Base API configuration with authentication setup
- ✅ Reading API endpoints defined
- ✅ Mock Service Worker (MSW) for development
- ✅ Proper error handling and loading states

### 3. Provider System

- ✅ Provider interfaces and types
- ✅ Demo implementations (TTS, Audio Player, Session)
- ✅ Provider registry and context
- ✅ Provider hooks for component usage

### 4. UI Components

- ✅ ApiDemo component showing passage data
- ✅ ProviderDemo component demonstrating provider usage
- ✅ Proper rendering of mock data

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Development with mock API
npm run dev:mock

# Visit http://localhost:3001
```

## 🧪 How to Test

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test
npm test -- src/features/reading/components/__tests__/ApiDemo.test.tsx
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Phase 4**: Enhance the reading slice to integrate with providers
2. **Phase 5**: Build the actual reading UI with word highlighting
3. Add more comprehensive tests
4. Implement real provider implementations
