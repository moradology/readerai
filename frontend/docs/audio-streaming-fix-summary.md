# Audio Streaming Fix Summary

## Problem

User was getting "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'totalChunks')" error when trying to play audio before the stream was initialized.

## Root Cause

The `loadChunk` method in `RealAudioDemoService` had multiple issues:

1. Redundant null checks that could fail after async operations
2. Direct access to `this.metadata` after async delays, which could become null if `stopStream()` was called
3. Poor error messages that didn't clearly indicate the problem

## Solution

### 1. Fixed loadChunk method

- Store metadata and audioBuffer references at the start of the method
- Use these local references throughout the async operations
- This prevents null reference errors if the class properties are cleared during async operations

```typescript
private async loadChunk(sequenceNumber: number): Promise<AudioChunk> {
  // Store references at start
  const metadata = this.metadata;
  const audioBuffer = this.audioBuffer;

  if (!metadata || !audioBuffer) {
    throw new Error('Stream not initialized. Call startStream() first.');
  }

  // Use local references throughout the method
  const bytesPerChunk = Math.floor(audioBuffer.byteLength / metadata.totalChunks);
  // ... rest of method
}
```

### 2. Improved error messages

- Changed from generic "metadata is null" to specific "Stream not initialized. Call startStream() first."
- Added chunk number in error messages for debugging

### 3. Comprehensive unit tests

Created `RealAudioDemoService.integration.test.ts` that tests:

- Playing before stream initialization
- Race conditions between startStream and getChunk
- Concurrent chunk loading
- stopStream during active chunk loading
- Edge cases with small audio files

## Result

- No more "Cannot read properties of null" errors
- Clear error messages guide users to the correct solution
- Robust handling of async operations and race conditions
- All tests pass successfully

## Testing

Run the integration tests:

```bash
npm test -- src/shared/audio/__tests__/RealAudioDemoService.integration.test.ts
```

## User Experience

Before: Cryptic null reference error
After: Clear message "Stream not initialized. Call startStream() first."
