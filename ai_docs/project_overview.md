# ReaderAI Project Overview

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Vision
ReaderAI aims to improve childhood literacy by providing an AI-powered reading companion that delivers interactive storytelling experiences. The system simulates the valuable parent-child reading dynamic for children who may not have regular access to such interactions.

### 1.2 Core Value Proposition
By combining text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and large language models, ReaderAI creates an engaging, educational reading experience that helps children develop literacy skills, vocabulary, and reading comprehension through natural interaction.

## 2. Key Capabilities

### 2.1 Automated Reading
- High-quality text-to-speech narration of children's books and stories
- Natural-sounding voices with appropriate pacing and inflection
- Visual highlighting of text being read to reinforce word recognition

### 2.2 Interactive Elements
- Comprehension questions based on passage content
- Vocabulary explanations tailored to the child's age and knowledge level
- Ability for children to ask questions about the text
- Personalized responses that encourage critical thinking

### 2.3 Adaptive Learning
- Adjusts difficulty and interaction style based on the child's responses
- Tracks progress over time to focus on areas needing improvement
- Recommends appropriate reading material based on interests and skill level
