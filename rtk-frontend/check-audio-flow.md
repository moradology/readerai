# Audio Flow Debug

The error "Stream not initialized. Call startStream() first." is now the correct error message (not a null reference).

The flow is:

1. User clicks Play
2. handlePlay checks isStreamReady() - returns false
3. handlePlay calls handleStartStream()
4. handleStartStream calls:
   - streamingService.startStream() - succeeds
   - audioPlayer.loadStream() - tries to load all chunks
   - streamService.getChunk() is called but might fail

This suggests the error is happening in loadStream when it tries to get chunks.

To verify: Check browser console for the exact error flow.
