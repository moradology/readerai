TEST_PASSAGE = """Deep within the subterranean labyrinth, far removed from the sun's familiar warmth, exists an ecosystem of profound mystery. Unlike the vibrant and often cacophonous world above, the cave maintained a quiet solemnity, broken only by the rhythmic drip of water or the skittering of unseen creatures. Here, a myriad of specialized organisms navigate the perpetual twilight, their forms often appearing translucent or lacking pigment altogether. Among the most captivating are the fungi clinging to the damp cave walls; they emit a faint, ethereal, bioluminescent glow. This strange light, however, is ephemeral, pulsing softly before fading, perhaps serving as a beacon in a complex, symbiotic relationship that underpins the delicate balance of this hidden world. Scientists approach the study of such environments with great trepidation, aware that even minor disturbances could irrevocably alter this fragile existence."""
